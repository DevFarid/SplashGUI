# SplashGUI
## Made by John Sundell, modified by Farid Kamizi.

## Purpose of the program.
Transform a Swift syntax string into a formatted div with CSS properties that match the Swift's syntax color within Xcode.

## Problems fixed by SplashGUI
Imagine you are writing an article for the Swift courses we offer, and you have to include programming expression and statements in your article.
The default carmen, format as code is a bit scuffed, and to be fair, not that visually appealing.

SplashGUI fixes that by taking a statement, expression, or a code block, and transforms it so your articles look neat!

## Example input
![SplashGUI Showcase](https://i.imgur.com/bGFA1uf.png "SplashGUI Showcase")
As you can see, the left panel of the application is the INPUT section. And the right panel of the application is the output.
Go ahead and copy the right side of the panel.

Now goto your article's content editor
![Canvas Content Editor](https://i.imgur.com/qneW72z.png "Canvas Content Editor")
Press the `</>` where you can view the source code of the content editor.
Gracefully paste the HTML/CSS code, in your Canvas's HTML/CSS content editor as shown below in the image.

Again, press the `</>` to switch back to the regular text editor, and now you should see the visual changes.
